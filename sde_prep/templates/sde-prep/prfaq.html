        Harsha Cheruku Launches SDE Prep Tracker: The First Integrated Interview Preparation Platform
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-600 italic mb-6">
        A 12-week structured learning system combining LeetCode tracking, system design mastery, behavioral prep, and real-time progress analytics—all in one place
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4"><strong>San Francisco, CA</strong> — Harsha Cheruku today announced the launch of the <strong>SDE Prep Tracker</strong>, a comprehensive software engineering interview preparation tool now live at fullstackpm.tech/tools/sde-prep.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The SDE Prep Tracker addresses a critical gap in interview preparation: most engineers juggle multiple tools (LeetCode, notion docs, spreadsheets, YouTube playlists) to prepare for technical interviews. This fragmentation leads to lost focus, scattered progress tracking, and no holistic view of interview readiness.

        "Most engineers fail at interview prep not because they can't code—they can. They fail because they're unprepared, unorganized, and unfocused," says Harsha. "The SDE Prep Tracker fixes that. It's like having a personal interview coach that keeps you on track, shows you exactly where you stand, and tells you when you're ready."
